That is, we're defining the variable question used in the component's file as the model object we're also referring to as question during each iteration of the loop, as defined when we state {{#each model.questions as |question|. To put it briefly, the question on the left of the = refers to the variable name used within the component and the question on the right refers to the model object we're assigning this variable to.}}--}}
